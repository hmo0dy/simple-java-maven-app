# simple-java-maven-app

A simple Java application using Maven for use with the CloudBees CI Workshop.

The CloudBees CI Pipeline Template used with this repository requires a specific file in each branch in order for that branch to be indexed and processed by the template job. That file name must be `cloudbees-ci.yml`. An example file, name `example.cloudbees-ci.yml` has been provided in this repository and all you have to do is rename that file to `cloudbees-ci.yml` to have the branch processed by the CloudBees CI template.
